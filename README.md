# Deep-Learning-Analysis-of-Gaming-Platform-Trends

## Project Overview
This project uses deep learning techniques to analyze historical trends in the gaming industry, focusing on platform popularity across Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft from 1980 to 2016. By leveraging deep learning models, such as Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, the analysis examines shifts in market dominance and key factors influencing platform success.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the ["Video Game Sales with Ratings"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings) dataset, which includes information on game titles, release years, platforms, sales data, and user ratings. Data is filtered to include only entries up to 2016, ensuring accurate historical analysis prior to the release of Nintendo Switch and other recent platforms.
